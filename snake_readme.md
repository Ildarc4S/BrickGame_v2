# School 21 - BrickGame - Tetris

Tetris is one of the most addictive games in the BrickGame series. Here is a classic interpretation of the game written in C, with ncurses-based console graphics to spice up the gameplay.

The game logic is based on finite state machines, a diagram of which you can see below.

### Game control
- **Start Game**: Press `s`
- **End the Game**: Press `q`
- **Pause the Game**: Press `p`
- **Move Left**: Press the `Left Arrow`
- **Move Right**: Press the `Right Arrow`
- **Accelerate (Move Down double)**: Press double the `Down Arrow`
- **Rotate the Tetramino**: Press `Space`

### Scoring
- Clearing `1` row: `100` points
- Clearing `2` rows: `300` points
- Clearing `3` rows: `700` points
- Clearing `4` rows: `1500` points

### Levels
- The game starts at level `1`.
- Every time you score `600` points, the level increases by `1`, and the speed of falling tetrominoes increases.
- The maximum level is `10`.

### End of the Game
The game ends when a new tetromino cannot be placed at the top of the playing field, meaning the blocks have piled up too high. Your final score will be displayed, and if itâ€™s higher than your previous best, it will be saved as the new high score

Good luck, and enjoy the game!
